# Predicting Decision Outcomes for US Immigration Data
 The data for this project was collected from the Kaggle. This data is collected from United States Citizenship and Immigration Services  (USCIS). 

#### Machine Learning Algorithms Employed
The machine learning algorithms which i have used are given below:
1) Neural Networks.
2) K-Nearest Neighbors.
3) Decision Tree.
4) Random Forest Classifier.
5) Gaussian Naive Bayes.
6) Linear SVM.
7) Logistic Regression.

#### Testing Validation Method
I have employed cross validation with 10 folds here. Additionally, training and test data are split into 70 / 30 ratio.

#### Libraries and Packages used
I have used sklearn package for importing and various the various different algorithms. Pandas for the data frames.

#### Undersampling for Handling the Class Imbalance
For handling the class imbalance, we undersampling techniques that make sure that there are equal number of positive and negative classes in the training data.
